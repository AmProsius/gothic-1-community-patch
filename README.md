## Building
Building the project is fully automated. VDF and NSIS setup are created in the sub-directory `build` by running `make`, `make all`, or `make remake` from Windows command prompt.

To build, the paths to the following software are required to be in the `PATH` environment variable:

 - [Make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
 - [GothicVDFS](http://www.bendlins.de/nico/gothic2/)
 - [NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/)

The Makefile is written and supported for Windows only.
