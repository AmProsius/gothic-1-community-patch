Changelog

* Fix: NPCs now always pick up their weapons after a lost fight.
* Fix: The player doesn't lose Strength as part of the quest "Horatio the Peasant" if he has more than 100 Strength.
* Fix: Jackal doesn't ask for protection money anymore if the player has already joined a camp.
* Fix: Vendors don't reequip their weapon when the player sells them a more powerful one. However, due to important game mechanics, they will still equip a weapon if they didn't have a weapon of that type (meelee, ranged) equipped earlier.
